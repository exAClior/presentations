  abstract = {The two-electron reduced density matrix (2RDM) carries enough information to evaluate the electronic energy of a many-electron system. The variational 2RDM (v2RDM) approach seeks to determine the 2RDM directly, without knowledge of the wave function, by minimizing this energy with respect to variations in the elements of the 2RDM, while also enforcing known N-representability conditions. In this tutorial review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of the v2RDM approach and the N-representability constraints that are typically applied to the 2RDM. We also discuss the semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques used in v2RDM computations and provide enough Python code to develop a working v2RDM code that interfaces to the libSDP library of SDP solvers.},

  abstract = {We present a heterogeneous central processing unit (CPU) + graphical processing unit (GPU) algorithm for the direct variational optimization of the two-electron reduced-density matrix (2RDM) under two-particle N-representability conditions. This variational 2RDM (v2RDM) approach is the driver for a polynomially scaling approximation to configuration-interaction-driven complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory. For v2RDM-based CASSCF computations involving an active space consisting of 50 electrons in 50 orbitals, we observe a speedup of a factor of 3.7 when the code is executed on a combination of an NVIDIA TITAN V GPU and an Intel Core i7-6850k CPU, relative to the case when the code is executed on the CPU alone. We use this GPU-accelerated v2RDM-CASSCF algorithm to explore the electronic structure of the 3,k-circumacene and 3,k-periacene series (k = 2--7) and compare indicators of polyradical character in the lowest-energy singlet states to those observed for oligoacene molecules. The singlet states in larger circumacene and periacene molecules display the same polyradical characteristics observed in oligoacenes, with the onset of this behavior occurring at smallest k for periacenes, followed by the circumacenes and then the oligoacenes. However, the unpaired electron density that accumulates along the zigzag edge of the circumacenes is slightly less than that which accumulates in the oligoacenes, while periacenes clearly exhibit the greatest buildup of unpaired electron density in this region.},
