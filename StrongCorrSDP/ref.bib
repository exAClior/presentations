  abstract = {The two-electron reduced density matrix (2RDM) carries enough information to evaluate the electronic energy of a many-electron system. The variational 2RDM (v2RDM) approach seeks to determine the 2RDM directly, without knowledge of the wave function, by minimizing this energy with respect to variations in the elements of the 2RDM, while also enforcing known N-representability conditions. In this tutorial review, we provide an overview of the theoretical underpinnings of the v2RDM approach and the N-representability constraints that are typically applied to the 2RDM. We also discuss the semidefinite programming (SDP) techniques used in v2RDM computations and provide enough Python code to develop a working v2RDM code that interfaces to the libSDP library of SDP solvers.},

  abstract = {We present a heterogeneous central processing unit (CPU) + graphical processing unit (GPU) algorithm for the direct variational optimization of the two-electron reduced-density matrix (2RDM) under two-particle N-representability conditions. This variational 2RDM (v2RDM) approach is the driver for a polynomially scaling approximation to configuration-interaction-driven complete active-space self-consistent field (CASSCF) theory. For v2RDM-based CASSCF computations involving an active space consisting of 50 electrons in 50 orbitals, we observe a speedup of a factor of 3.7 when the code is executed on a combination of an NVIDIA TITAN V GPU and an Intel Core i7-6850k CPU, relative to the case when the code is executed on the CPU alone. We use this GPU-accelerated v2RDM-CASSCF algorithm to explore the electronic structure of the 3,k-circumacene and 3,k-periacene series (k = 2--7) and compare indicators of polyradical character in the lowest-energy singlet states to those observed for oligoacene molecules. The singlet states in larger circumacene and periacene molecules display the same polyradical characteristics observed in oligoacenes, with the onset of this behavior occurring at smallest k for periacenes, followed by the circumacenes and then the oligoacenes. However, the unpaired electron density that accumulates along the zigzag edge of the circumacenes is slightly less than that which accumulates in the oligoacenes, while periacenes clearly exhibit the greatest buildup of unpaired electron density in this region.},

  abstract = {We present an exact ansatz for the eigenstate problem of mixed fermion-boson systems that can be implemented on quantum devices. Based on a generalization of the electronic contracted Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger equation (CSE), our approach guides a trial wave function to the ground state of any arbitrary mixed Hamiltonian by directly measuring residuals of the mixed CSE on a quantum device. Unlike density-functional and coupled-cluster theories applied to electron-phonon or electron-photon systems, the accuracy of our approach is not limited by the unknown exchange-correlation functional or the uncontrolled form of the exponential ansatz. To test the performance of the method, we study the Tavis-Cummings model, commonly used in polaritonic quantum chemistry. Our results demonstrate that the CSE is a powerful tool in the development of quantum algorithms for solving general fermion-boson many-body problems.},

  abstract = {Here we present a many-body theory based on a solution of the \$N\$-representability problem in which the ground-state two-particle reduced density matrix (2-RDM) is determined directly without the many-particle wave function. We derive an equation that re-expresses physical constraints on higher-order RDMs to generate direct constraints on the 2-RDM, which are required for its derivation from an \$N\$-particle density matrix, known as \$N\$-representability conditions. The approach produces a complete hierarchy of 2-RDM constraints that do not depend explicitly upon the higher RDMs or the wave function. By using the two-particle part of a unitary decomposition of higher-order constraint matrices, we can solve the energy minimization by semidefinite programming in a form where the low-rank structure of these matrices can be potentially exploited. We illustrate by computing the ground-state electronic energy and properties of the H\$\_\{8\}\$ ring.},
