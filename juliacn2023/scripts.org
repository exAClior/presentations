* Introduction to ZX-calculus
** ZX-calculus: the definition
阐明‘演算’一词： "当我们提到‘ZX演算’时，这里的‘演算’并不是我们熟知的传统演算。它
更接近中文的‘演算’，意味着‘依照一定的原理、公式计算’。"

解释‘ZX’： "'ZX'在ZX演算中指的是其基本组成部分：Z和X蜘蛛。"
Z和X蜘蛛 - 基础知识：
"Z和X蜘蛛是ZX演算语言的核心，是参数化的张量。"
"两个关键参数："
"腿的数量 - 反映张量网络语言。"
"相位参数 - 代表张量中两个非零元素之一的相位。"
视觉表示： "这些蜘蛛在图中被可视化展示，构成我们在量子计算中图形语言的基础。"
[过渡到下一部分]

为下一步设定舞台： "现在我们已经掌握了基本组成部分，让我们更深入地探讨这些蜘蛛如何相互作用，形成ZX演算计算的基础。"

** ZX-Diagram
Moving forward, let's delve into the heart of ZX-Calculus: the ZX Diagrams.
These diagrams are more than just figures; they are graphical representations
that encapsulate the complexities of tensor networks in quantum computing.

Each tensor in a ZX Diagram is uniquely characterized by two key features. First
is the number of legs or edges it has, which represent the dimensions or
connections in the tensor network. The second is the angle of rotation, a
parameter that adds an additional layer of information to the tensor,
representing various quantum states or operations.

Through these ZX Diagrams, we can visually interpret and manipulate complex
quantum operations that would otherwise be challenging to grasp. They serve as a
bridge, simplifying abstract quantum computing concepts into more tangible and
understandable forms.

With a foundational understanding of ZX Diagrams, we are now ready to bridge
these concepts with something more familiar in quantum computing: the quantum
circuit representations. This comparison will illuminate how ZX Diagrams
correspond to and can simplify our understanding of quantum gates and
operations.

** Example: From Circuit to ZXDiagram
In our exploration of ZX Diagrams, a fundamental point stands out: their
universality in representing quantum circuits. This universality means that any
quantum gate or operation you encounter in quantum computing can be translated
into a ZX Diagram. This is a powerful aspect, making ZX Diagrams a versatile and
indispensable tool in the field.

Consider the Z and X spiders we discussed earlier. These are just the tip of the
iceberg. Every quantum gate, from the simple Z and X gates to more complex ones,
can be represented within the ZX Diagram framework. This ability to translate
and simplify various quantum operations into intuitive diagrams is what makes
ZX-Calculus so unique and valuable.

This overview of the universality of ZX Diagrams sets the stage for our next
segment. We will now shift our focus to a practical demonstration, where we'll
take a detailed look at how a specific quantum circuit can be translated into a
ZX Diagram. This example will highlight the practical application and
effectiveness of ZX Diagrams in quantum computing.

** Example: from quantum circuit to ZX diagram

In this segment, we delve into a practical application of ZX-Calculus. We'll
take a specific quantum circuit and demonstrate how it can be translated
step-by-step into a ZX Diagram. This process not only illustrates the
versatility of ZX Diagrams but also their power in simplifying complex quantum
operations.

Let's consider [insert a brief description or name of the example quantum
circuit]. This circuit, which performs [describe the function or operation of
the circuit], will serve as our example. We'll break down each element of this
circuit and show how it corresponds to elements in a ZX Diagram.

As we go through this translation, you'll see how the complex interplay of
quantum gates and operations in the circuit is elegantly represented in the ZX
Diagram. This example will illustrate the practicality of ZX-Calculus in
visualizing and simplifying quantum computing concepts.

** Rewrite Rules and Completeness
In our exploration of ZX Diagrams, an important question arises: Why do we
transition to using ZX Diagrams in quantum computing? The answer lies in the set
of transformative rules provided by ZX-Calculus and the concept of completeness.

ZX-Calculus is not just a collection of diagrams; it's a comprehensive system
governed by a set of rules. These rules allow us to transform different ZX
Diagrams into each other, enabling us to represent and manipulate complex
quantum operations in a simplified graphical form.

Now, let's talk about completeness. In the realm of ZX-Calculus, completeness is
defined as follows: 'A graphical calculus is complete when its rewrite rules are
powerful enough to prove any true equation.' What does this mean in practice? It
means that if two diagrams represent the same linear map, then there is a
sequence of rewrites that can transform one diagram into the other. This
property is crucial. It ensures that any quantum operation or state that can be
expressed in a linear map can be fully represented and manipulated within the
ZX-Calculus framework.



Firstly, the Slide Secretary should ask the user before creation of the content
what is the background knowledge assumed for the audiences. If the user's answer
needs more clarification, keep asking. When this is clear, the Slide Secretary
should have two personalities in mind. The first one is the one that is
knowledgeable in the area the user want to present. This personality will be
able to check the factual status of user's input. This personality will also be
able to give suggestions on how to create slides. Another personality will be
the one that has the same amount of background knowledge as the user prompts.
This personality will check whether EVERY SINGLE bit of information provided in
the slide is understandable to the users. This includes keywords, figures,
pharses etc. The Slide Secretary will always remember to take a deep breath and
cover the above points step by step and outputing his steps of reasoning. Just
following the principle of "thinking aloud". Please update the configure
according to my input. Please show me the updated version of prompt. Annotate it
to show how each line of the prompt achieves what I ask for.

* Summary and Credits
Before diving into the technicalities of ZXCalculus.jl, it's important to
acknowledge its origins. ZXCalculus.jl was initially developed as a
collaborative effort between Dr. Chen Zhao and Dr. Xiu-zhe Roger Luo. At the
time, Dr. Zhao was a Ph.D. student at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute
of Mathematics and Systems Science, while Roger Luo was pursuing his Ph.D. at
the University of Waterloo.

Their collaboration was part of the Google Summer of Code, a global program that
offers student developers stipends to write code for various open-source
software projects. This initiative laid the groundwork for what ZXCalculus.jl is
today, a testament to the international and collaborative nature of software
development in quantum computing.

With this background in mind, let's delve deeper into the functionalities and
features of ZXCalculus.jl.
